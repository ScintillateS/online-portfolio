				<p style ="text-align: justify;">Hi, my name is Sahil Sandasani and I am a sophomore at Dublin High School. 
				My personal career goals are to explore different career paths and graduate high school knowing which career path to
					focus on. I am currently taking AP CSP and maintaining my GPA in
					order to explore the computer science career path and decide on
					whether to pursue a master’s degree in computer science at a
					college such as University of California, Berkeley. I looking
					forward down that career path so far, but I am also looking forward
					to exploring other career paths such as cybersecurity, electrical
					engineering, and other types of engineering. I have had a strong
					interest in engineering ever since I discovered what it meant and
					did my first engineering project. After developing small toys like
					catapults and making small lego robots, I was introduced to
					computer science by using Arduino and Scratch to program robots.
					After playing around with Scratch and creating my own games such as
					“angry flappy birds”. I decided to move on from block coding and
					analyzed the Java programming that was used underneath the Scratch
					and Code.org blocks. Eventually, I began programming in Java and
					Python, and enjoyed it, leading to my interest in computer science.
				</p>

				<p style ="text-align: justify;">Some of my high school accomplishments
					consist of sustaining my United States Chess Federation rating of
					over 1000 through several chess tournaments where I suffered losses
					and gained victories, maintaining persistence in practicing before
					every tournament. Another accomplishment was getting accepted into
					the Academic Talented Development Program through UC Berkeley for a
					summer course, where I applied to several programs and eventually
					made it into a prestigious Web Development course. Some activities
					both in school and outside of school I have participated in include
					the Dublin High Chess Club, the Gael Force Robotics Team, Track and
					Field, Toastmasters International, and Civil Air Patrol.</p>

				<p style ="text-align: justify;">From my high school experience in my
					activities, I have learned that I am much more open to new people
					than I thought that I would be. Ever since the pandemic rolled
					around, I became very quiet and mostly talked with my family and
					family-friends as most of my friends grew distant. Once I enrolled
					in several clubs at high school, I felt as though I opened up again
					and made many new friends through my clubs, even by cooperating in
					group projects during AP CSP. I continued in maintaining my
					friendships by talking to my friends over calls.</p>

				<p style ="text-align: justify;">Thanks for reading! All in all, I have
					begun quite a journey, but I am sure that I have a long way to go
					in order to meet my goals by gaining experience in other fields of
					engineering as well in order to finalize my career path. Hopefully,
					you are now more interested in accomplishing your goals as I now
					know what mine are and how I am going to achieve them. Feel free to
					check out the rest of the site in order to understand more about me
					and how I came to be.</p>
