        Hi, my name is Sahil Sandasani and I am a sophomore at Dublin High School. My personal career goals are to explore different career paths and graduate high school knowing which career path to focus on. I am currently taking AP CSP and maintaining my GPA in order to explore the computer science career path and decide on whether to pursue a master’s degree in computer science at a college such as University of California, Berkeley. I looking forward down that career path so far, but I am also looking forward to exploring other career paths such as cybersecurity, electrical engineering, and other types of engineering. I have had a strong interest in engineering ever since I discovered what it meant and did my first engineering project. After developing small toys like catapults and making small lego robots, I was introduced to computer science by using Arduino and Scratch to program robots. After playing around with Scratch and creating my own games such as “angry flappy birds”. I decided to move on from block coding and analyzed the Java programming that was used underneath the Scratch and Code.org blocks. Eventually, I began programming in Java and Python, and enjoyed it, leading to my interest in computer science.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Some of my high school accomplishments consist of sustaining my United States Chess Federation rating of over 1000 through several chess tournaments where I suffered losses and gained victories, maintaining persistence in practicing before every tournament. Another accomplishment was getting accepted into the Academic Talented Development Program through UC Berkeley for a summer course, where I applied to several programs and eventually made it into a prestigious Web Development course. Some activities both in school and outside of school I have participated in include the Dublin High Chess Club, the Gael Force Robotics Team, Track and Field, Toastmasters International, and Civil Air Patrol. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">From my high school experience in my activities, I have learned that I am much more open to new people than I thought that I would be. Ever since the pandemic rolled around, I became very quiet and mostly talked with my family and family-friends as most of my friends grew distant. Once I enrolled in several clubs at high school, I felt as though I opened up again and made many new friends through my clubs, even by cooperating in group projects during AP CSP. I continued in maintaining my friendships by talking to my friends over calls.</p>
  
        <p class="text-justify">Thanks for reading! All in all, I have begun quite a journey, but I am sure that I have a long way to go in order to meet my goals by gaining experience in other fields of engineering as well in order to finalize my career path. Hopefully, you are now more interested in accomplishing your goals as I now know what mine are and how I am going to achieve them. Feel free to check out the rest of the site in order to understand more about me and how I came to be.</p>
